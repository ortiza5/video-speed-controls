Why be stuck at 1x playback speed when you can go all the way to 16x?

# Description
An extension for Chrome based browsers that is used to change the playback speed of HTML5 videos.

* This is my first extension, so it is rough around the edges. A rewrite is underway to fix some of the issues I have found through use and to implement features I never got around to finishing.

# Current Issues
- extension popup controls never finished
- multiple videos on a page not controllable
- no customization for hotkeys
- no settings page
